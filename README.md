# VoidPro
A dynamic compression engine that adapts and overcomes storage limits.

The next-gen solution that allows you to store multiple games and their large game files, irrespective of the storage limit on your computer, using smart compression and decompression.

Here's the inital approach to the project: 
Let me break it down:
Current Feasibility:
1.	Game Compression Tools: Some launchers, like Steam's "Shrink Game Files," already offer ways to optimize the storage of installed games by removing unnecessary files.
2.	Compression Software: You can manually compress game directories using general-purpose tools like 7-Zip or WinRAR. However, the trade-off is slower access times since files need to be decompressed when played.
3.	On-the-Fly Decompression: Technologies like Microsoft's DirectStorage and NVMe SSDs are optimized to handle fast decompression directly on modern hardware, making real-time game decompression feasible without significant performance hits.
4.	Compressed File Systems: Some operating systems support compressed drives (like Windows NTFS compression), which automatically decompress files as needed without the user manually intervening.
________________________________________
Potential Challenges:
•	Performance Overhead: Decompressing large files in real time can impact game load times or performance, especially if the game is graphics-intensive.
•	File Integrity Risks: Frequent decompression and recompression may increase the risk of corrupted files.
•	Storage Trade-offs: Compressed files save space but may reduce read/write speeds depending on your hardware.
________________________________________
Future Prospects:
With advancements in:
•	Real-Time Data Decompression: Leveraging GPUs for rapid decompression.
•	Smart Game Asset Streaming: Storing only essential assets locally while streaming less critical data.
Now, building a software solution to automatically compress game files upon download and installation, and decompress them before execution, is technically feasible but involves several challenges and considerations. Here’s how we could approach it:
________________________________________
1. Conceptual Design
Compression Process:
•	Monitor game download and installation directories.
•	Compress all files using an efficient algorithm (e.g., LZMA, Zstandard).
•	Maintain metadata to track file structure and ensure correct decompression during execution.
Decompression Process:
•	Before launching the game, decompress all required game files back to their original state.
•	Use system triggers (hooks) to automate this decompression step seamlessly during game launch.
•	Delete decompressed files after the game session if space efficiency is critical.
________________________________________
2. Technical Implementation
Key Steps:
1.	File System Integration:
Implement a virtual file system layer that transparently handles compressed files.
2.	User Interface:
Provide controls for users to:
o	Compress/Decompress games manually or automatically.
o	Monitor available storage space and compressed data sizes.
3.	Compression Algorithms:
Choose fast and efficient algorithms for minimal decompression delays:
o	Zstandard: Offers a good balance between compression speed and file size reduction.
o	LZ4: Prioritizes speed, ideal for real-time scenarios.
4.	Data Integrity Checks:
Implement CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) or hashing to verify file integrity after decompression.
________________________________________
Performance Overhead
Decompressing files all at once before game execution would mitigate runtime performance issues. However:
•	Load Times: Games with large assets (e.g., open-world games) may face longer initial load times due to full decompression.
•	Disk Usage: Temporary decompression requires sufficient free space.
Optimizations could include:
•	Pre-loading critical files while decompressing non-essential assets in the background.
•	Smart caching for frequently accessed files.
________________________________________
Minimum System Requirements
•	CPU: Quad-core processor for efficient multi-threaded compression/decompression.
•	RAM: At least 8 GB (16 GB recommended) for handling decompressed files in memory.
•	Storage: NVMe SSD recommended for faster file operations.
•	OS: Modern operating systems supporting virtual file systems (Windows 10/11, Linux).
________________________________________
File Corruption Risks
The risk of corruption is generally low but depends on:
1.	File System Reliability: Using SSDs reduces the risk compared to HDDs.
2.	Compression/Decompression Integrity: Proper validation checks during decompression mitigate risks.
3.	Frequency of Operations: Playing a game 10 times a week under normal conditions would not significantly increase corruption risks.
Estimated Risk: With proper safeguards, corruption rates should remain below 0.1% per session for stable systems.

Final Thoughts
This project is ambitious and technically challenging but achievable.
Detailed Breakdown: Simplified
Let's dive into a detailed breakdown of how we can go about creating software that automatically compresses and decompresses game files. This will include the system architecture, key components, and considerations for implementation.
________________________________________
System Architecture
The architecture for this software will have multiple components that interact with each other. The key elements are:
1.	File Monitoring System – Watches the game download and installation directories.
2.	Compression/Decompression Engine – Handles the actual compression of files and decompresses them on the fly.
3.	Metadata Management – Keeps track of the files and their compressed status to ensure seamless decompression when needed.
4.	User Interface – Allows the user to configure the software, view compressed games, and monitor disk space usage.
5.	Integrity Checking – Ensures that files are correctly decompressed and that no corruption occurs.
________________________________________
Key Components
1. File Monitoring System
The file monitoring system is responsible for tracking any new files as the game downloads and installs. When a new game installation is detected, this system will kick off the compression process. Here’s how you can design it:
•	File System Watcher: This will monitor the game installation folders for changes using a service like FileSystemWatcher on Windows or inotify on Linux.
``` 
o	Windows (C#): 
o	FileSystemWatcher watcher = new FileSystemWatcher();
o	watcher.Path = @"C:\Games";  // Game installation directory
o	watcher.NotifyFilter = NotifyFilters.FileName | NotifyFilters.LastWrite;
o	watcher.Created += OnFileCreated;  // Trigger compression upon new file creation
o	watcher.EnableRaisingEvents = true;
o	Linux (Python): 
o	import os
o	import sys
o	import time
o	from watchdog.observers import Observer
o	from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
o	
o	class Watcher(FileSystemEventHandler):
o	    def on_created(self, event):
o	        if event.is_directory:
o	            return
o	        compress_game_files(event.src_path)
o	
o	event_handler = Watcher()
o	observer = Observer()
o	observer.schedule(event_handler, path='/path/to/games', recursive=False)
o	observer.start()
```
2. Compression/Decompression Engine
The engine will compress the game files when they are downloaded and install them. When a game is run, it will automatically decompress files to memory or disk before execution.
•	Compression Process:
o	Use a lossless compression algorithm to reduce file sizes. Zstandard (ZSTD) is a great choice for fast and efficient compression.
o	Compress game files into an archive (e.g., .zst or .lz4).
o	Track the state of files (whether compressed or decompressed).
•	Decompression Process:
o	Before a game is launched, the software will decompress the necessary files into memory (RAM) or the temporary directory.
o	Use multi-threading or parallelization to speed up decompression and improve performance.
•	Code Example:
```
o	Python (Using Zstandard for compression/decompression): 
o	import zstandard as zstd
o	
o	def compress_file(input_file, output_file):
o	    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
o	        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
o	            cctx = zstd.ZstdCompressor()
o	            cctx.copy_stream(f_in, f_out)
o	
o	def decompress_file(input_file, output_file):
o	    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
o	        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
o	            dctx = zstd.ZstdDecompressor()
o	            dctx.copy_stream(f_in, f_out)
```
•	Decompression and Running Game:
o	The software should first decompress the necessary files.
o	After decompression, the game is executed in its normal manner.
3. Metadata Management
Metadata will track which files are compressed and their corresponding decompressed versions. This is crucial to ensure the game runs without errors.
•	Database or File System-Based Tracking:
o	You can use a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) to store metadata about each game and the corresponding compressed files.
o	Alternatively, store metadata in a flat file (JSON, XML) if the database is overkill.
•	Example Metadata Structure (JSON):
```
•	{
•	  "game_name": "Game X",
•	  "files": [
•	    {"file_path": "game_data/assets/textures/file1.dat", "compressed": true},
•	    {"file_path": "game_data/assets/music/file2.dat", "compressed": false}
•	  ]
•	}
```
4. User Interface
The user interface should be simple and intuitive. It will display the status of compression for each game, allow users to manually trigger compression or decompression, and monitor available storage.
•	UI Framework: 
o	Electron (JavaScript, Node.js): Build a cross-platform app.
o	Qt (C++/Python): For a native GUI experience.
The interface could display:
•	Games currently compressed and decompressed.
•	The ability to compress/decompress games on demand.
•	Storage usage statistics and warnings.
________________________________________
Performance Considerations
1.	Pre-emptive Decompression:
o	Decompressing all files at once before the game starts could be beneficial for graphics-intensive games because it reduces runtime overhead.
o	However, temporary disk space usage will increase, so a sufficient amount of free space is required for decompressed files (likely around 50% more space than the compressed files).
o	Memory Usage: Games that have large textures or assets may require significant memory (e.g., 8 GB or more of RAM) for decompressed data.
2.	Lazy Decompression:
o	For large games, you can implement a lazy decompression approach, where critical files are decompressed first, and less essential assets are decompressed while the game is running.
________________________________________
File Corruption Risk
•	Compression/Decompression Corruption: 
o	If implemented correctly, using checksum verification and file integrity checks (e.g., MD5, SHA256) during decompression should keep corruption rates low.
o	Risk Level: 
	If you’re compressing files but keeping the system stable, the corruption risk should be around 0.01%-0.1% over multiple game sessions (assuming proper system design and file integrity checks).
	Frequent Play: 10 times a week of normal usage should not drastically increase corruption risk.
________________________________________
Minimum System Requirements
•	Operating System: 
o	Windows 10/11 or Linux (64-bit), macOS (optional for cross-platform support).
•	CPU: 
o	Quad-core CPU (Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 or higher).
•	RAM: 
o	8 GB minimum (16 GB recommended for large games or large decompression tasks).
•	Storage: 
o	SSD: NVMe SSD with at least 100 GB free space (depending on the number and size of games).
•	Graphics: 
o	Not crucial for the software itself, but a dedicated GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX/RTX or AMD equivalents) may be required if real-time decompression is offloaded to the GPU in future versions.

Final Thoughts
This software could become a powerful tool for gamers looking to optimize their disk space while playing larger games. The major challenges will revolve around handling performance efficiently and ensuring that no files are corrupted during the compression/decompression cycles.


Basic Protoype: 
Creating a prototype for the software we’re looking to build involves several steps. For simplicity and scalability, we'll focus on a basic compression-decompression prototype for game files, written in Python. This will demonstrate how to automatically compress files after installation and decompress them when the game is run.
Prototype Overview
1.	File Compression: Automatically compress game files into a .zst file after they are installed.
2.	File Decompression: Automatically decompress files when the game is launched.
3.	Metadata Management: Keep track of which files are compressed or decompressed.
We’ll use Zstandard (ZST) for compression and decompression due to its efficiency and speed.
________________________________________
1. Install Dependencies
First, you need to install the required libraries:
•	Zstandard for compression/decompression.
•	Watchdog to monitor file changes (game installation directory).
pip install zstandard watchdog
________________________________________
2. Create the Prototype Code
Here's the Python code to create a prototype for the compression/decompression system:
File Compression and Decompression Script
```
import zstandard as zstd
import os
import shutil
import json
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
# Helper Functions for Compression and Decompression
def compress_file(input_file, output_file):
    """Compress a file using Zstandard."""
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            cctx = zstd.ZstdCompressor()
            cctx.copy_stream(f_in, f_out)
    print(f"Compressed: {input_file} -> {output_file}")

def decompress_file(input_file, output_file):
    """Decompress a Zstandard file."""
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            dctx = zstd.ZstdDecompressor()
            dctx.copy_stream(f_in, f_out)
    print(f"Decompressed: {input_file} -> {output_file}")

# Metadata Management: Keeps track of compressed/decompressed files
metadata_file = 'game_metadata.json'

def load_metadata():
    """Load the metadata file."""
    if os.path.exists(metadata_file):
        with open(metadata_file, 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    return {}

def save_metadata(metadata):
    """Save metadata to file."""
    with open(metadata_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(metadata, f, indent=4)

# Watchdog Event Handler: Monitor the directory for new files
class GameInstallationHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_created(self, event):
        """Triggered when a new file is created in the directory."""
        if not event.is_directory:
            print(f"New file detected: {event.src_path}")
            compress_game_file(event.src_path)

def compress_game_file(file_path):
    """Compress the game file and update metadata."""
    compressed_file = f"{file_path}.zst"
    compress_file(file_path, compressed_file)

    metadata = load_metadata()
    metadata[file_path] = {"compressed": True}
    save_metadata(metadata)

def decompress_game_file(file_path):
    """Decompress the game file before running."""
    compressed_file = f"{file_path}.zst"
    if os.path.exists(compressed_file):
        decompressed_file = file_path  # Original file path
        decompress_file(compressed_file, decompressed_file)
        return decompressed_file
    return file_path

# Game Execution Simulation (for testing)
def run_game(game_file):
    """Simulate game run by decompressing and executing the game."""
    print(f"Running game with file: {game_file}")
    game_file = decompress_game_file(game_file)
    print(f"Game is now running from: {game_file}")

# Watch for new files in a game installation directory
def start_monitoring(directory):
    """Start watching a directory for new game files."""
    event_handler = GameInstallationHandler()
    observer = Observer()
    observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)
    observer.start()
    print(f"Started monitoring {directory} for new files...")

    try:
        while True:
            pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        observer.stop()
    observer.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Directory to watch for new game installations
    game_install_directory = "./games"

    # Start monitoring the directory
    start_monitoring(game_install_directory)

    # Simulate running a game (for testing)
    run_game("./games/game_example_data/file1.dat")
```

3. How This Prototype Works
File Compression and Decompression:
•	The compress_file function compresses a file using Zstandard.
•	The decompress_file function decompresses a file.
•	Files are tracked in a JSON metadata file to know if they have been compressed or not.
File System Monitoring:
•	Watchdog is used to monitor the specified directory (./games) for new files. When a new file is detected, it is automatically compressed using compress_game_file.
Simulate Running a Game:
•	The run_game function simulates a game launch. It first checks if the file is compressed and decompresses it if necessary before "running" the game.
________________________________________
4. Running the Prototype
1.	Create a directory (e.g., ./games) and add some test files (e.g., file1.dat).
2.	Run the Python script.
3.	When a new file is added to the ./games folder, the script will automatically compress it using Zstandard.
4.	You can simulate "playing" the game by calling run_game(), which will decompress the game files as needed.
________________________________________
5. Next Steps for Development
•	Improved Compression Strategy: You may want to optimize which files get compressed and which stay uncompressed (e.g., for large texture files or frequently accessed assets).
•	Efficient Decompression: Implement an in-memory decompression strategy for larger game files to avoid excessive disk writes.
•	Error Handling and File Integrity: Add file validation (e.g., CRC checks or SHA256 hashes) to ensure files aren’t corrupted during compression/decompression.
•	User Interface: Develop a simple interface to show game status, storage usage, and allow manual compression/decompression triggers.
________________________________________
6. System Performance Considerations
•	File Size: Larger games might need more RAM or disk space for decompression.
•	Compression Speed: Compression will take time depending on the game size, but this can be done asynchronously.
•	Decompression Speed: This should be fast if the decompressed files are stored in memory (if the system has sufficient RAM).
