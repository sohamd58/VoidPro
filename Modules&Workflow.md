## Module Definitions

**1. main.py**
* **Purpose:** Entry point and command-line interface for the compression engine.
* Parses command-line arguments
* Provides three main operations: `compress`, `decompress`, and `analyze`
* Formats and displays statistics and results to the user
* Handles high-level error reporting

**2. compression_engine.py**
* **Purpose:** Core coordinator that manages the entire compression/decompression workflow.
* Orchestrates the file analysis, compression, and decompression processes
* Manages directory traversal and file handling
* Tracks and stores compression statistics and metadata
* Ensures proper input/output directory structure
* Maintains the compressed file format standards (`.gcmp` and `.gcmeta`)

**3. file_analyzer.py**
* **Purpose:** Intelligence layer that analyzes files to determine optimal compression strategy.
* Categorizes files by type (text, image, audio, executable, etc.)
* Calculates Shannon entropy of file data to measure compressibility
* Analyzes byte distribution and patterns in files
* Determines if files are already compressed
* Recommends the most suitable compression algorithm based on file characteristics

**4. compression_algorithms.py**
* **Purpose:** Implements multiple compression algorithms and provides a unified interface.
* Supports multiple algorithms: `zlib`, `gzip`, `lzma`, `bz2`, `zstd`, `lz4`, `brotli`
* Handles algorithm-specific compression settings and levels
* Falls back to alternative algorithms if a requested one is unavailable
* Benchmarks compression performance (ratio, speed) across algorithms
* Generates metadata about the compression process

**5. decompression.py**
* **Purpose:** Handles the decompression of files compressed with any supported algorithm.
* Determines the compression type from metadata or file signatures
* Provides algorithm-specific decompression implementations
* Restores original file structure and names
* Handles graceful degradation when metadata is missing

**6. utils.py**
* **Purpose:** Provides utility functions used across the codebase.
* Sets up logging configuration
* Calculates file sizes and compression ratios
* Formats file sizes for human readability
* Handles directory creation and management
* Provides file extension utilities
* Detects binary vs text files

## Data Flow

**Analysis Flow:**

```
main.py → compression_engine.py → file_analyzer.py → utils.py
```

* User requests file analysis
* Engine traverses directories and collects files
* Analyzer examines each file and generates recommendations
* Results are formatted and displayed to user

**Compression Flow:**

```
main.py → compression_engine.py → file_analyzer.py → compression_algorithms.py → utils.py
```

* User requests compression
* Engine traverses directories and collects files
* Analyzer recommends optimal algorithm for each file
* Compression is applied using the recommended algorithm
* Metadata and compressed files are saved with statistics

**Decompression Flow:**

```
main.py → compression_engine.py → decompression.py → utils.py
```

* User requests decompression
* Engine locates compressed files and metadata
* Decompression module restores original files
* Statistics about the process are reported

## Key Features

* **Intelligent Algorithm Selection:** Automatically selects the best compression algorithm based on file characteristics
* **Metadata Tracking:** Stores compression details to ensure proper decompression
* **Comprehensive Statistics:** Provides detailed metrics about compression performance
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling throughout the pipeline
* **Extensibility:** Modular design allows easy addition of new compression algorithms
* **Multi-algorithm Support:** Implements 7 different compression algorithms with fallback options

This modular architecture ensures each component has a single responsibility, making the code maintainable, extensible, and easy to understand.
