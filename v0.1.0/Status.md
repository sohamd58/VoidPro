# Priority List for Planned Components

## HIGH PRIORITY 

- **Large File Optimization** - See `OPTIMIZATION_ROADMAP.md` for detailed implementation plan
  - Implement streaming processing for compression and decompression
  - Add memory management to handle extremely large files (up to 300GB)
  - Implement parallel processing for better performance
  - Create sampling-based analysis for large files

## Medium Priority

- Documentation
  - Add comprehensive API documentation
  - Create detailed function comments throughout codebase
  - Improve user guide with examples

- Configuration System
  - Implement configuration file support
  - Add user-configurable algorithm preferences
  - Create compression presets (fast, balanced, maximum)

- Testing
  - Add more comprehensive test cases
  - Create performance benchmarking suite
  - Test with real game asset directories

## Low Priority

- Package Structure
  - Clean up project for distribution
  - Create proper Python package
  - Set up for PyPI distribution

- User Interface
  - Add progress reporting for long operations
  - Improve CLI experience with color output
  - Consider simple GUI wrapper
  
- Additional Features
  - Support for more file formats
  - Custom compression profiles for game engines
  - Integration helpers for game development environments
